POL30 interesting case on legs 3 & 4. Aircraft takes off at Essendon, flies toward Ballarat, then disappears for two hours. Reappears suddenly near Mitchell Park airport.
Altitude change is negligible, there is a positive change between last point before landing, and next point after takeoff.

This trace contains a combination of NULL positions and other null data points. Essentially, this is to test & create a system that is able to support partially corrupt flight point data.

Partial flight #3 does not have a valid takeoff airport because the very very first point does not have a position.
This log should be used to devise a technique to counter-act this.
